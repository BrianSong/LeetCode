Reverse a singly linked list.

Example:

Input: 1->2->3->4->5->NULL
Output: 5->4->3->2->1->NULL

Iteratively solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution(object):
    def reverseList(self, head):
        prev = None
        current = head
        while current:
            next = current.next     # first store other linked list information  
            current.next = prev     # let current's next equal to prev e.x. orginially 1.next = 2, here we let 1.next = None
            prev = current          # Since prev will be use in the assignment so it need to be updated every loop, this loop's current is 
                                    # next loop's current
            current = next          # Of course, current need to be updated to next in order to jump off the while loop in the future
            '''
            After changing, 
            1.next = None,
            2.next = 1
            3.next = 2
            4.next = 3
            5.next = 4
            So, 5-4-3-2-1
            '''
        return prev
