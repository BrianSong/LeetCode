Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place. ---------------------------- in place: we cannot create another linked list

For example, given the following tree:

    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \   \
3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

1
 \
  2
   \
    3
     \
      4
       \
        5
         \
          6
          
Solution: --------------------------------------- DFS ----------- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfKRZ_qCmYQ

'''
If you notice carefully in the flattened tree, each node's right child points to the next node of a pre-order traversal.
Since we cannot forsee what is the next node in the pre-order traversal, 
what we can do is to do the reversed pre-order traversal where we can store the previous node in our reversed pre-order traversal
what is exactly the next node in a normal pre-order traversal, then we can assign it to the currnode.right

            Why we can set root.left to None directly without have a temp to avoid data lossing of the left subtree nodes?
            Because the left subtree information has already be saved into the self.prevnode in the last recursion level
