Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:

Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1

Solution: --------------------- https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=139&v=qq64FrA2UXQ (works for both positive)
'''
For this, problem, for example, we have a = 1, b = 3,

In bit representation, a = 0001, b = 0011,

First, we can use "and"("&") operation between a and b to find a carry.

carry = a & b, then carry = 0001

Second, we can use "xor" ("^") operation between a and b to find the different bit, and assign it to a,

Then, we shift carry one position left and assign it to b, b = 0010.

Iterate until there is no carry (or b == 0)

HOWEVER, In python: the recursion will not end given input a=1, b=-1, as a and b just keeping increasing. => TLE ERROR
The issue is due to the way python performs left shift on negative numbers.
