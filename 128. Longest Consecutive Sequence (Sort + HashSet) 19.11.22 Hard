Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:

Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.


Solution no.1: ---------------------------------------- Sort
------------------------------------------------------- O(nlogn) T, O(1) S

            elif nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:            # If the current number and the previous are equal, 
                                                    # then our current sequence is neither extended nor broken, 
                                                    # so we simply move on to the next number.
                                                    # for example: [100,4,200,1,3,2,2]

Solution no.2: ---------- HashSet, why we choose hashset? because as hashtable, they all support O(1) lookup => if num in set? => O(1) T
------------------------- O(n) T, O(n) S
