You are given an integer array nums and you have to return a new counts array. 
The counts array has the property where counts[i] is the number of smaller elements to the right of nums[i].

Example:

Input: [5,2,6,1]
Output: [2,1,1,0] 
Explanation:
To the right of 5 there are 2 smaller elements (2 and 1).
To the right of 2 there is only 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 6 there is 1 smaller element (1).
To the right of 1 there is 0 smaller element.


Solution: ------------------------------------------------------- MergeSort
'''
The smaller numbers on the right of a number are exactly those that jump from its right to its left during a stable merge sort. 
So I do mergesort with added tracking of those right-to-left jumps.

                        if a statement is followed by a "or", as long as it is true, the whole condition will be true
                        and the further statment behind "or" will not be processed.
                        elif a statement is followed by a "and", as long as it is false, whole will be false, no need further processing
                        else, we will process the further statements.
