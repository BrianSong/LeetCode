Given an array of integers, 
find out whether there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that the absolute difference between nums[i] and nums[j] 
is at most t and the absolute difference between i and j is at most k.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3, t = 0
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1, t = 2
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,5,9,1,5,9], k = 2, t = 3
Output: false

Solution: ----------------------------- Bucket ---------------------------------- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yc4hCFzNNQc (14 mins)
--------------------------------------- O(n) T, O((max - min) / t + 1) S i.e. the number of bucket we have
'''
The idea is like the bucket sort algorithm. 
Suppose we have consecutive buckets covering the range of nums with each bucket a width of (t+1). 
If there are two item with difference <= t, one of the two will happen:

(1) the two in the same bucket
(2) the two in neighbor buckets

So, when k = 5, the d will become:
{
    0: for containing number from 0 ~ 5
    1: for containing number from 6 ~ 11
    2: for containing number from 12 ~ 17
    3: for containing number from 18 ~ 23
    ...
    
}
