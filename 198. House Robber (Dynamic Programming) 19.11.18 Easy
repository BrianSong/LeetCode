You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, 
the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected 
and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, 
determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

Input: [1,2,3,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
Example 2:

Input: [2,7,9,3,1]
Output: 12
Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).
             Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.

4 steps for DP problem:--------- 当前状态是与之前的状态有关的，或者是由之前的状态直接得到的！！！！！！
-------------------------------- Instead of getting the exact house getting robbed, the question only asks us the total money/ T&F => DP
1. Status variable: for each house, we have 2 choices: rob or not rob,
                    so, we define two status variable: two list:
                    if we rob the current house, the maximum money we can get: r[n]
                    if we do not rob the current house , the maximum money we can get: nr[n]
2. Init: r[0] = nums[0], nr[0] = 0
3. Transformation: r[i] = nr[i - 1] + nums[i], since if we want to rob this house, we cannot rob the previous house,
                   and the nr[i - 1] by definition, is the maximum money that we do no rob the previous house,
                   so, we just add them up.
                   nr[i] = max(r[i - 1], nr[i - 1]), as for nr[i], things are a little more tricky,
                   since we can choose to rob the previous house and  we can choose not to rob the previous house,
                   so, we just take their maximum, the larger one.
                   As for the r[i], it has no choices like this, since, if we choose to rob the current house,
                   there is no way for us to define robbing the previous house as a option, 
                   we have only one choice: not rob the previous house, which is nr[i - 1]
4. Return: return the larger value out of r[n] and nr[n]
