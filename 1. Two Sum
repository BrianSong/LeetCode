Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].

Solution no.1: ok for normal case, but failed because of "Time Limit Exceeded" : 运算时间太长，需要优化
This code's time complexity is o(n^2), as you know, N will bigger than 16000, so this complexity is unacceptable

    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        res = []
        currlist = []
        curridex = 0

        return res

        if len(currlist) < 2:

                self.twoSum_help(nums, target - nums[i], res, currlist, i + 1)
                currlist.pop()

Solution no.2: -------------------------------- Hashtable

    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        dic = {}                         # Create a dictionary that record the value and its index
        for i, n in enumerate(nums):     # for example: dic = {0:2, 1:7, 2:11, 3:15}, key:value
            if n in dic:                 # value in dic not key in dic
                return(dic[n], i)        # dic[key] -> value. key is like a special index
            else:
                dic[target - n] = i
