Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return null.

To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer pos which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list 
where tail connects to. If pos is -1, then there is no cycle in the linked list.

Note: Do not modify the linked list.

 

Example 1:

Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
Output: tail connects to node index 1
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.


Example 2:

Input: head = [1,2], pos = 0
Output: tail connects to node index 0
Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the first node.


Example 3:

Input: head = [1], pos = -1
Output: no cycle
Explanation: There is no cycle in the linked list.

        The logic behind the 2nd part is like this:

        Consider the following linked list, where E is the cylce entry and X, the crossing point of fast and slow.
        H: distance from head to cycle entry E
        D: distance from E to X
        L: cycle length
                          _____
                         /     \
        head_____H______E       \
                        \       /
                         X_____/   
        
    
        If fast and slow both start at head, when fast catches slow, slow has traveled H+D+n1L and fast 2(H+D+n1L). 
        because slow = slow.next and fast = fast.next.next, and n1 is the number of cycle loop slow travels before meeting
        Assume fast has traveled n2 loops in the cycle, we have:                                             
        2(H+D+n1L) = H + D + n2L  -->  H + D = (n2 - n1)L (there is no doubt fast travels more loop than slow, i.e. n2 > n1)
        So, H = nL - D, where n == n2 - n1, it is a constant.
        Thus if two pointers start from head and X, respectively, where they meet will be the cycle entry E
        Why? let's consider when head travels H and reach E point, the slow travels nL - D from X point,
        L - D is the distance counted from X to E and (n-1)L bring slow back to where it starts,
        so, after traveling (n-1)L + L - D = nL -D, slow will also reach E point at that time,
        i.e., the first time head and slow meet, the meeting point is the cycle entry E !
        '''
        while head != slow:             # The second part determines the entry of the cycle if it exists
            head = head.next
