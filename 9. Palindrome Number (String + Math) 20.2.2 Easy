Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

Solution no.1: ------------------------------------------- convert the integer to a string
-------------------------------------------------- but this would require extra non-constant space for creating the string
-------------------------------------------------- O(l) T => [::-1], O(l) S => creating string, where l is the length of the integer

Solution no.2: ------------------------------------ Follow up answer (without convert the number into a string)
--------------------------------------------------- O(log10x) T where x is the input integer, O(1) S

Except converting the number into string,
Second idea would be reverting the number itself, and then compare the number with original number, 
if they are the same, then the number is a palindrome. 
However, if the reversed number is larger than int.MAX, we will hit integer overflow problem.

Solution no.3: ---------------------------------------- convert half the number
------------------- Time complexity : O(log10(n)) because we divided the input by 10 for every iteration, n is the input integer's value
------------------- or O(l) T where l is the integer's length
------------------------------------- Space complexity : O(1).
'''
Following the thoughts based on the second idea, to avoid the overflow issue of the reverted number, 
what if we only revert half of the \text{int}int number? 
After all, the reverse of the last half of the palindrome should be the same as the first half of the number, 
if the number is a palindrome.
