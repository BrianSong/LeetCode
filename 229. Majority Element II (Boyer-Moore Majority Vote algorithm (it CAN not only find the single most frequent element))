Given an integer array of size n, find all elements that appear more than âŒŠ n/3 âŒ‹ times.

Note: The algorithm should run in linear time and in O(1) space.

Example 1:

Input: [3,2,3]
Output: [3]
Example 2:

Input: [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
Output: [1,2]

Solution: ---------------------------------- Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm (it CAN not only find the single most frequent element)
-------------------------------------------- O(n) T, O(1) S
'''
The essential concepts is you keep a counter for the majority number X. 
If you find a number Y that is not X, the current counter should deduce 1. 
The reason is that if there is 5 X and 4 Y, there would be one (5-4) more X than Y. 
This could be explained as "4 X being paired out by 4 Y".

And since the requirement is finding the majority for more than ceiling of [n/3], 
the answer would be less than or equal to two numbers. So we can modify the algorithm to maintain two counters for two majorities.
