Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of longest increasing subsequence.

Example:

Input: [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4 
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4. 
Note:

There may be more than one LIS combination, it is only necessary for you to return the length.
Your algorithm should run in O(n2) complexity.

The MOST important part in dynamic programming is 
how to come up with one proper dp[] that can link the past half with current situation.
Here, I first used dp[] to represent the maximum LIS start from this point, and cannot work
So, I used dp[i] to represent the maximum LIS of the list end i
For example:
[10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
dp[0] = LIS of [10]
dp[1] = LIS OF [10,9]
dp[2] = LIS OF [10,9,2]
dp[3] = LIS OF [10,9,2,5]
...
If we find the dp[] properly, the transformation function is very clear,
if nums[j] > nums[i]:
    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)
BTW, the time complexity for DP is usually O(n^2)
